This repository contains the files for "Book-Store Application".

I have made it using Webforms in .NET, and Entity Framework.
For the Database, I have used "MS SQL Server".

I have implemented these 7 features within my application:
1) User Login
2) Registration
3) Show Books
4) Add to Cart
5) Add to Wishlist
6) Place Order
7) Order History
